           <p1 class="color">The <b> Best Mutton Biryani </b> Recipe ever! Prepared with utmost care and love, this Mutton Biryani holds a regal legacy from the kitchen of Nawabs and Nizams that needs no introduction or special mentions.</p1><br>
           <p>The beautifully spiced and fragrant layers of biryani rice centred with juicy,tender meat and spices<br>is pure bliss! Let us see<b> how to make</b> this biryani at home.
           <h1 id="mili">About the recipe</h1>
           <p>Today, I am sharing the most demanding authentic Bombay <b>Mutton Biryani</b>  recipe with you all. Generally, the meat biryani is made by two methods.</p><br><br>
           <p>One is the <b> Hyderabadi Kacche Gosht ki Biryani</b> and the other method is <b> pakki gosht ki biryani</b>. And my this particular recipe falls under the pakki category.</p><br><br>
           <h2>Here is the difference between the two methods:-</h2> 
           <p>In <b> Kacchi mutton biryani </b> , the layer of marinated and uncooked meat pieces is placed as the bottom layer. Then the cooked rice is layered on the top of marinated meat layer followed by the process of slow cooking</p><br><br>
           <p>Whereas in Pakki mutton biryani, we cook the marinated mutton first. And then we layer it between the rice. In this method, we do not use raw papaya paste at all. For the reason, we will be cooking the meat well before the layering part.</p><br></b>
           <p>Usually, any recipes of biryani do involve a series of steps to follow. It indeed includes marination, to cook mutton, to cook rice, layer the cooked mutton and rice and then dum it.</p><br></br>
           <p>Another important thing that makes the biryani royal and rich in taste is the making of birista. Birista, particularly, is the most effort indulging process of making as per many people.</p><br><br>
           <p>We were told as a kid that a person who can make a perfect birista is the one who can make anything. And I took that too seriously in my head.</p><br><br>
           <p>Right from chopping to frying, it is an eye keeping procedure. And, if you miss the point of turning off the flame at the right time, you may probably burn the onions.</p><br><br> 
           <p>Meat Marination Ingredients</h1><br>
           <p>Let us get our hands over to the meat marination. The recipe of mutton biryani calls for goat meat (lamb) on bone. Clean and wash it well, then drain all the water, if any.</p><br><br>
           <p>Then, you need to make a paste of fresh ingredients to gives a nice spicy and tasty punch to the meat.  So, assemble peppercorns, cardamoms, cloves, garlic cloves, ginger pieces, coriander leaves and green chilies. Now, grind these all in into a paste.</p><br><br>
           <p>After that, take thick yoghurt, birista, garam masala powder and ground paste into a bowl, and marinate the mutton pieces into it.</p><br><br>
           <p>Further, the other elements that we need to make mutton masala base are sliced onions, cumin seeds, cinnamon sticks, tomatoes, green chilies. The spice powders that goes in are red chili powder, turmeric powder and coriander powder.</p><br><br>
           <h2>To Boil Rice And Layering The Biryani</h2>
           <p>I have used long grain basmati rice, bay leaves, shah jeera, cinnamon sticks, cloves, star anise, water, ghee and green cardamom (choti elaichi).</p><br><br>
           <p>You will need some more ingredients here as well. So, gather a stack full of mint leaves, birista, saffron soaked in milk and ghee are perfect enough to go with the layering.</h3><br><br>
           <p>The homemade mutton biryani may seem to be pretty lengthy in process with too many preparations. Trust me, it is very easy to make</p><br><br>
           <h1>How To Make Mutton Biryani</h1>
           <h2>Let’s get started with step by step images for our lip smacking Bombay style mutton biryani recipe:</h2><br>
           <h2>Step 1 - Preparation And Marination</h2>
           <p>1. To begin with, first, add all the ingredients mentioned under "to grind to paste" into a blender and blend it to a fine paste.</p><br>
           <p>2. Then, in a large bowl, add ground paste, ¼  cup fried onions, whisked curd, and garam masala powder along with salt.</p>
           <p>3. Now, add clean and washed mutton and mix well.</h3>
           <p>4. Allow the mutton to marinate for at least 2 hours (preferably over night) under refrigeration.</p>

           <h2>Step 2 - Frying The Potatoes</h2>
           <p>5. Once the mutton is ready to cook, then heat oil in a pan, add potato cubes.</p>
           <p>6. Fry the potatoes until golden. Then take them out and set it aside for later use.</p>

           <h2>Step 3 - Cooking The Mutton Biryani Gravy</h2>
           <p>7 & 8. First, heat oil in a heavy bottom pan or handi. Then, add sliced onions, salt and fry until pink.</p>
           <p>9. Once the onions softens, add cinnamon sticks and cumin seeds and cook.</p> 
           <p>10. Fry everything until onions starts picking up golden colour, do not over brown or burn it.</p>
           <img src="Mutton-Biryani-Recipe-Steps-1.jpg" width="530" height="420">
           <p>11. Now, add marinated mutton and sauté on high 5-6 minutes until raw small goes off.</p>
           <p>12. Then, add red chilli powder, turmeric and coriander powder and mix. Now, add 2 cups of water, cover and cook the mutton until tender.</p>
           <p>This will take approx 50 minutes as I have made it in handi. Do not over cook the mutton at this stage. Keep stirring in between to avoid burning. If water dries up, you may add more.</p>
           <p>Note : You can make it pressure cooker as well to save time. Also, make sure, if you are cooking it in pressure cooker, do not add to much water at a time. We need to cook it such that not much water is left in cooked mutton.</p>
           <p>13. Now, add tomato slices, fried potatoes and chilies and cook for another 5 minutes.</h3>
           <p>14. You will see oil layer on the top, and mutton masala has not much water into it. This is the perfect mutton masala for biryani recipe. Now, carefully scoop out the layer of oil in a bowl and set it aside for later use.</p>

           <h2>Step 4 - Cooking The Rice</h2>
           <p>15. While the mutton cooks, clean and wash the rice and soak it for 45 minutes.</h3>
           <p>16. Then, in a large pot, add enough water, bay leaves, cinnamon sticks, shajeera (or cumin seeds), cloves, cardamom, star anise, ghee and salt. Bring it to a boil.</p>
           <p>17. Once the water starts boling, starin the soaked rice and add into boiling water.</h3>
           <p>18. Cook the rice until 90 percent done.</h3>
           <p>Note : Do not over cook or rice will get sticky and will break in biryani. Immediately strain the water and set the rice aside.</p>

           <h2>Step 5 - To Layer The Biryani</h2>
           <p>19. Now, in a large pot in which you want to slow cook or dum the rice and meat, add half the cooked rice as a bottom layer.</p>
           <p>20. Then, add the cooked mutton and spread evenly.</p>
           <p>21. Sprinkle mint leaves, 1 tablespoon ghee, ½ of the soaked saffron and birista.</p>
           <p>22. Then, add the remaining rice over the meat layer evenly.</p>

           <p>23. Now, pour remaining ghee, saffron milk and reserved oil that we scooped out from the masala gravy.</p>
           <p>24. Finally, put a clean cotton cloth over the top and cover it with the lid putting heavy weight on the top of the lid. Slow cook (dum) the biryani for 20 minutes, first on high flames for 5 minutes and then simmer for 15 minutes.</p>

           <h2>Expert Tips</h2>
           <ins><b>Rice:</b></ins>
           <p>Most noteworthy here is, always use aged best quality long grain basmati rice. Never ever compromise on this point. Longer the grains of rice better will be the mutton biryani, both visually as well as in taste. I prefer to use at least 1 year aged Basmati rice for making biryani.</p><br>
           <p>Some people also like to use sella rice as well. Hence you may choose it if you want to. But, the basmati rice is always the winner.</p>
           <ins><b>Meat Cut :</b></ins>
           <p>Personally, I love to use a little large than medium sized pieces of a lamb or goat shoulder meat cut. It gives a nice and tender chunks when cooked perfectly. However, you can use raan (hind leg meat cut)  to make mutton biryani.</p>
           <ins><b>Marination :</b></ins>
           <p> Always marinate the meat in masala for at least 2 hours, I prefer the marination overnight. Yes, marination is the soul to any of the biryani recipes except the egg biryani.</p>
           <ins><b>Cooking Rice and Biryani :</b></ins>
           <p> Be sure to cook the rice as mentioned, i.e 90 percent which is exact 9 minutes from the point when rice starts boiling on high heat. Also, do not stir the rice too much while boil as it may break the rice grains, hence, the result will not be as we want it to be</p><br><br>
           <p>Lastly, do not use thin bottom pan, always use heavy bottom pan or handi or dutch oven to make the dish. For the final dum, always, cook the biryani on high for 5 minutes and them simmer to dum for 15 minutes. This helps in generating steam well cooking the rice perfectly each time.</p>
