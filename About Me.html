                <p><b>Hi I'm Kemili Debbarma!</b>  and I'm from Agartala, Tripura. The cook, writer and photographer behind this little blog. I’ve grown up in the kitchen along side my mum and grandmothers and conversations in my family are always about the next meal. I’ve picked up their love for food along the way, and with this blog, I share my food story with you.</p>
