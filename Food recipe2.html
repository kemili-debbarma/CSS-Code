                   <p>I always thought making mutton curry is a long and laborious<br> process that needs hours of prep and cooking time. But you<br> shouldn't have to wait so much for good things in life!<p><br>
                   <p>But this easy mutton curry qualityrecipe is different. What I love about this recipe is that it requires very little prep, uses simple, everyday ingredients and is ready in under an hour.If you’re wondering how, I’ve got you! I have simply replaced long hours of prep and marination with a store-bought mutton curry masala and it has been a complete game changer! This means that my lamb curry is now ready in half the original time without any compromise on taste! The result - a heartwarming mutton curry that’s<br> homely, spicy and a total flavour bomb!</p>

            <h1>What is Mutton Curry Made of ?</h1>  
            <p>This mutton curry recipe usequalitys onions and tomatoes as the base,</p>
            <p> which is then flavoured using different whole and ground spices.</p> 
            <p>The hero ingredient of this recipe is the meat masala (different</p> 
            <p>from rry powder most commonly available abroad), responsible for</p> 
            <p>giving this whole dish that distinctive warm and spicy flavour.</p><br><br>
            <p>(2) Turmeric: Helps eliminate that slightly gamey taste of raw mutton.</p>
            <p>(3) Oil: I like using mustard oil, butquality any other cooking oil will work</p>
            <p>(4) Spices: This recipe mainlyquality uses whole spices to pack in a tonne of flavour.I have<br> used fennel seeds, bayleaf, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, cloves and green chillies.<br> Apart from this, you’d also need some coriander powder and garam masala for an extra<br> flavour boost.</p>
            <p>(5) Meat Masala: Hands down the star ingredient of the whole dish and<br> the reason why it comes together so quickly. I've used readymade Mutton<br> Masala.This is different from curry powder so specifically look for meat<br> masala, chicken masala or mutton masala. In the U.S. you can buy<br> it on Amazon / If you are in the U.K. buy it here <br>on Amazon</p>
            <p>(6) Potatoes: Potatoes soak up tqualityhe flavour from the meat and masalas,<br> thereby enhancing the whole dish. Not a necessary ingredient, but highly<br> recommended.</h3>
            <p>(7) Kasuri methi: Dried fenugreek leaves-A commonly used ingredient in Indian curries<br> added at the end for a hint of smokiness and to bring everything together.<br> Even though this one’s optional too, it’s one I highly recommend using.</p>
            <p>(8) Ghee or butter: Takes the flavour of the whole dish a notch higher. Do not skimp on this!</p>

            <h1>Instructions</h1>
            <p>(1) Add turmeric and 1 teaspoon salt to the mutton or lamb and rub all over. Set aside while you prep everything else</p>
            <p>(2) Heat oil in a pressure cooker (electric or stovetop) and saute fennel seeds, bayleaf, cinnamon, cardamom and <br>cloves for a minute. Add two green chillies, onions and ginger garlic paste. Cook this for 10-12 <br>minutes stirring occasionally till the onions are a deep brown.</p>
            <p>(3) Add tomatoes, coriander powder, meat masala and the remaining salt and cook for 5 minutes till the tomatoes<br> break down slightly.</h3>
            <p>(4) Stovetop Pressure Cooker: Add mutton, potatoes and two cups of water and put the lid on. If using a stovetop <br>pressure cooker, cook on high pressure for 20-25 minutes (5-6 whistles).</p>
            <p>(5) Instant Pot: If using an electric pressure cooker or an instant pot, cook for 20 minutes on high pressurenand<br> let the pressure release naturally or manually release the pressure after 15 minutes.</p>
            <p>(6) Once the pressure is released, open the lid and switch on the flame again. Add more water if the gravy is too thick. Stir in garam<br>masala,kasuri methi (if using), remaining green chillies, julienned ginger and ghee and simmer for another 3-4 minutes.</p>
            <p>(7) Check and adjust seasoning. Let the curry rest for 15 minutes before serving.</h3>
            <h1>Notes</h1>
            <p>(1) Any cut of lamb or mutton is good for this curry but make sure its bone-in. Shoulder works best as it has the best<br>flavour and tenderises really well</p>
            <p>(2) Meat masala is easily available at Indian stores. I use Lala's brand, Everest masalas are also highly recommended.</h3>
            <p>(3) Kasuri Methi is dried fenugreek leaves that help round up the flavours in the dal makhani. Its available<br> on amazon,and is used in many Indian recipes (on this blog), so stocking it won't be a waste</p>
            <p>(4) Don't skimp on the oil in the recipe. This is necessary for the masalas to fry properly as well as for the lamb pieces to toast well.</p>
            <p>(5) Feel free to adjust the spice levels based on your tastes by reducing or increasing the green chillies</h3>
            <p>(6) Cut the mutton pieces into similar sizes to help them cook evenly.</h3>
            <p>(7) To make this recipe even quicker and easier you can use a food processor to chop the onions and tomatoes.<br> Once everything is chopped and ready, all would need to do is fry and pressure cook until done.</p>
            <p>(8) Make sure to cook the onions really well before adding the meat - to the point of them becoming deep brown.Bhunoing the<br>masala is an important step as it helps to release flavours and is what gives your mutton curry that typical dark brown colour.</p>
            <p>(9) If you are using frozen mutton, make sure to thaw it out properly on the kitchen counter before adding it to the pressure cooker</p>
